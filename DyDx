The protocol for Decentralized Financial Derivatives. 

-supports margin trading and options
-actually decentralzied 
-uses 0x and ethereum as the base tech

White Paper Overview 

-decentralzied derivative protocol
  -derivatives are just agreements between two parties - options, futures, etc

Abstract
   We present a set of protocols that allow several types of financial derivatives to be
  created, issued, and traded for any pair of underlying ERC20 tokens. Our approach uses
  off-chain order books with on-chain settlement to allow creation of efficient markets. All
  described protocols are fair and trustless, creating truly open markets that are not
  governed by a central authority. The protocols are extensible by anyone, requiring no
  special permissions to be used with other smart contracts.
  
Into 
  -DyDx helps create new assets that get value from underlying blockchain assets
  -Adavantages: no regulated clearing house, global equal access, full control of funds
  -make orders off chain - make settlements on chaiin 

Margin Trading 
  -logic contained in Ethereum smart contracts
  -two sets of instructions - one for lending one for buying 
  -uses a wrapper class to allow users to use any decentralized exchange on top of protocol 
  -users can easily open and close positions which happen using smart contracts 
  -A repuitation system is needed to rank lenders on chances they close prematurely 
 
 Options
  -supports standard call and pull options 
  -one ethereum SC for each type of option
  -can make these options on any ERC-20 token 
  
Governance
  -goverance held in mutlisig wallet held by individuals 
  -considering a DOA for goverance

● dYdX
    ○ Decentralized derivatives protocol
    ○ Built on Ethereum and 0x
    ○ Open and free to use
    ○ Efficient markets are enabled using off-chain 0x orders and economic incentives for price
    discovery
    ○ Modular, extensible smart contracts allow continuous opt-in upgrades
● Margin Trading
    ○ Can be used to profit on downward price movements, or increase leverage
    ○ Providing low risk fully collateralized loans for margin trades can provide interest fee on
    long positions
    ○ Anyone can margin trade or lend any ERC20 token
● Options
    ○ Can be used to reduce risk or speculate
